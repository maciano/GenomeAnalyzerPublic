Given the parents and the child. I want to measure the percentage of mutations in the SNPs(Single-nucleotide_polymorphism) genotypes. Then compare these mutated SNPs with SNPedia DB to identify risky mutations and % of mutation improvement.
i.e:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Persona</td>
    <td>SNP</td>		
    <td>Genotype</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Father</td>
    <td>Rs7903146</td>		
    <td>CT</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mother</td>
    <td>Rs7903146</td>		
    <td>CT<</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Child</td>
    <td>Rs7903146</td>		
    <td>TT<</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Rs7903146 = "TT" <br>
Magnitude = 3.5<br>
Frecuency=10.6%<br>
Repute=Bad: 2x increased risk for Type-2 diabetes- <br>
